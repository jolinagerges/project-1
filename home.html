                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                     It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
                    Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                     consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                      source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
                      Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
                       Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
                    comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                                standard dummy text
                                 ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
                                  it to make a type specimen book. 
                                 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                                  typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                                 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                                 and more recently with 
                                 desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</h3></td>
